# NordVPN Linux Client

A simple python command-line client for NordVPN. It allows you to discover which servers and types of VPN are available. In addition it provides you the best server for each country and/or type of VPN. Mostly motivated by the absence of NordVPN official clients for Linux distributions.

## Getting Started

You need to have python3 installed on your machine. Just the python standard library is used.

If you want to use the `connect` functionality you need to have also OpenVPN installed and set up for NordVPN, for this you can look [here](https://nordvpn.com/tutorials/linux/openvpn)

## Usage

`./vpn connect|find \'country\' [\'service\']`

## Help

`./vpn`
