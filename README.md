# NordVPN Linux Client

A simple python command-line client. Mostly motivated by the absence of official clients for Linux distributions.

## Getting Started

You need to have python3 and OpenVPN installed on your machine. Just the python standard library is used.

OpenVPN must then be set up for NordVPN, for this you can look [here](https://nordvpn.com/tutorials/linux/openvpn)
